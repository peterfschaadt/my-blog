    <link href="http://peterschaadt.com/blog/2013/03/04/upgrading-to-django-1.5/"/>
    <updated>2013-03-04T00:00:00-08:00</updated>
    <id>http://peterschaadt.com/blog/2013/03/04/upgrading-to-django-1.5</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Recently I upgraded a Django site from 1.4.5 to the new <a href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/releases/1.5/">1.5</a> release. I decided to upgrade before my Django app got more complex and I wanted to check out the new <a href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/topics/auth/customizing/#auth-custom-user">configurable user model</a>. I'll cover some problems I had when upgrading and show replacements for some deprecated methods.</p>

<p>I did a quick <code>pip install django==1.5</code> and hoped for the best. Unfortunately my heart sank when I ran <code>python manage.py runserver</code> after upgrading and was greeted with an error message (DEBUG set to true in settings) about some import statements. Nothing in software comes easy.</p>

<p>Like a lot of sites on the web, my Django app has a <a href="http://www.robotstxt.org/">robots.txt</a> and a <a href="http://humanstxt.org">humans.txt</a> file. With Django 1.4.5 I had been serving these text files with the <code>direct_to_template</code> method, with a mimetype of "text/plain." I realized I'd have to switch to Django's shiny new class-based generic views and remove the deprecated method. Note that "mimetype" has been changed to "content_type" also.</p>

<p>``` python urls.py
from django.conf.urls import patterns, url
from django.views.generic import TemplateView</p>

<p>urlpatterns = patterns('',</p>

<pre><code>url(r'^robots\.txt$', TemplateView.as_view(template_name='robots.txt', content_type='text/plain')),
url(r'^humans\.txt$', TemplateView.as_view(template_name='humans.txt', content_type='text/plain')),
</code></pre>

<p>)
```</p>

<p>Another problem I had was the invalid import of <code>from django.views.generic.simple import redirect_to</code> which has been deprecated in 1.5. To get around that I changed my view code to use <code>redirect</code> instead.</p>

<p>``` python views.py
from django.shortcuts import redirect</p>

<p>def page_view(request):</p>

<pre><code># View code here
return redirect('/other-page/')
</code></pre>

<p>```</p>

<p>You could also use Django's class-based generic views to put the redirect in a URL rule in your urls.py file.</p>

<p>``` python urls.py
from django.conf.urls import patterns, url
from django.views.generic import RedirectView</p>

<p>urlpatterns = patterns('',</p>

<pre><code>url(r'^page-url', RedirectView.as_view(url='/other-page/'))
</code></pre>

<p>)
```</p>

<p>I hope these examples help someone out who had the same problems as me. I was still impressed with how seamless the upgrade to 1.5 was and I had fewer things to fix than I thought I would. Upgrade early and upgrade often!</p>

    <link href="http://peterschaadt.com/blog/2012/03/26/my-setup/"/>
    <updated>2012-03-26T16:43:00-07:00</updated>
    <id>http://peterschaadt.com/blog/2012/03/26/my-setup</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2>What do I use?</h2>

<p>This post is inspired by <a href="http://usesthis.com">UsesThis</a>, a site that highlights individuals and their development setups. I have a lot of people that ask me what I use in my development workflow so I'd like to put it out there. I'll try to update this as frequently as I can when things change.</p>

<h2>Operating System: <a href="http://www.apple.com/osx/">OS X Mountain Lion 10.8.2</a></h2>

<p>I was a long-time Windows fan but once I started doing serious development work Cygwin just wasn't cutting it anymore. I had some problems with OS X Lion, notably with compiling MySQL and with support for full-screen apps, but the latest release of Mountain Lion seems to work much better for me.</p>

<h2>Browser: <a href="https://www.google.com/intl/en/chrome/browser/beta.html">Google Chrome Beta</a></h2>

<p>Google Chrome's silent updates and syncing features (including tabs!) keep my browser up to date between my laptops and desktops. I've always loved Firefox but I stopped using it as my primary browser once Google Chrome expanded its collection of extensions. Firefox has fixed some of the memory bloat and I still use it frequently for debugging with Firebug, but I've become attached to the speed and usability of Google Chrome. The <a href="https://www.google.com/intl/en/chrome/browser/canary.html">Canary release</a> provides even more cutting-edge features and can be used alongside your standard Chrome install.</p>

<h2>Text Editor: <a href="http://www.sublimetext.com/2">Sublime Text 2</a></h2>

<p>When I used Windows I was a fan of Notepad++ and I looked for something similar when I switched to Mac OS X. I do not find the features of Textmate or BBEdit to be worth the cost and ever since I've discovered Sublime Text Editor I haven't looked back. I haven't checked it out yet but a <a href="http://www.sublimetext.com/blog/articles/sublime-text-3-beta">Sublime Text 3 Beta</a> was recently released.</p>

<h2>IDE: <a href="http://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/">Jetbrains PyCharm</a></h2>

<p>PyCharm isn't cheap but anyone who's familiar with Jetbrains IntelliJ (for Java) knows that Jetbrains knows how to make productive, yet attractive, IDEs. PyCharm also offers great Django and Flask support. I've used Eclipse for university projects but it's always been too cumbersome and slow for me.</p>

<h2>Terminal: <a href="http://www.iterm2.com/#/section/home">iTerm2</a>, <a href="http://zsh.sourceforge.net/">ZSH</a>, and <a href="https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh">oh-my-zsh</a></h2>

<p>Coming from PowerShell and Cygwin, the default terminal app was a blessing. Then I found iTerm2 which offers split panes, search, autocomplete, instant replay (mostly just for fun), and custom profiles. Before long I had switched from Bash to ZSH (Z Shell) (just a <code>chsh -s /bin/zsh</code> away!) and oh-my-zsh. There is much better support for extended globbing, path expansion, command line history, and oh-my-zsh adds support for configuring your prompt and choosing a color theme to suit your preferences.</p>

<h2>Mail: <a href="http://www.sparrowmailapp.com/">Sparrow</a></h2>

<p>This excellent and intuitive mail application offers the best desktop Gmail support for Macs. I was dismayed to find out that the team had been hired by Google and that development would cease. That said, the app is still very usable.</p>

<h2>Office Suite: <a href="http://www.libreoffice.org/">LibreOffice</a></h2>

<p>While the Microsoft Office Suite reigns over almost every Windows install, their offering for Macs is an entirely different beast. I uninstalled OpenOffice after a few days of using it and settled on LibreOffice. Their productivity apps are fast and I prefer their traditional look.</p>

<h2>Mockups: <a href="http://www.balsamiq.com/">Balsamiq</a></h2>

<p>For those quick, interactive, but not high-fidelity mockups, I haven't found a better tool than Balsamiq. In addition to producing great software, I've reached out to the Balsamiq Team before about support issues and received prompt feedback with a solution. Their Mockups To Go page offers downloads for additional UI elements like Twitter's <a href="https://mockupstogo.mybalsamiq.com/projects/web/Bootstrap">Bootstrap</a> and Apple's <a href="https://mockupstogo.mybalsamiq.com/projects/ios/iPad+Controls">iPad</a> which have been very helpful.</p>

<h2>VM: <a href="https://www.virtualbox.org/">VirtualBox</a></h2>

<p>Sadly, when I enabled Full Disk Encryption on my MacBook Air I was no longer able to dual-boot with Linux. Since then I've run my Ubuntu OS (usually 12.04) using VirtualBox. It's a really useful program and it doesn't seem to slow down my computer as much as other virtual machine tools.</p>

<h2>Media: <a href="http://videolan.org">VLC</a>, <a href="http://xbmc.org/">XBMC</a> 12.0 RC2 Frodo</h2>

<p>For those odd file types, VLC handles everything with ease. I've even had a lot of luck with it playing corrupted files. I prefer to not have iTunes managing my media library so I just open my Music directory with VLC and it works great.
For managing movies and TV shows, you just can't beat XBMC. It fetches background art, HD trailers, and IMDB ratings for every movie in your collection. This is all with the default configuration. There's also an amazing remote control app for your Android device called <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.leetzone.android.yatsewidgetfree&amp;hl=en">Yatse</a>.</p>

    <link href="http://peterschaadt.com/blog/2012/02/28/installing-redis-on-mac-os-x-lion/"/>
    <updated>2012-02-28T00:00:00-08:00</updated>
    <id>http://peterschaadt.com/blog/2012/02/28/installing-redis-on-mac-os-x-lion</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>This post will give you a quick overview of installing the latest stable version of <a href="http://redis.io">Redis</a> on Mac OS X Lion 10.7.3.</p>

<p>Fire up the Terminal app on your Mac and fetch the Redis package.</p>

<p><code>
wget http://redis.googlecode.com/files/redis-2.4.8.tar.gz
</code></p>

<p>If you don't have wget, you can install it with <a href="http://mxcl.github.com/homebrew/">Homebrew</a>.</p>

<p><code>
brew install wget
</code></p>

<p>Now extract the Redis archive, navigate to the folder, and run <code>make</code>.</p>

<p><code>
tar xzf redis-2.4.8.tar.gz
cd redis-2.4.8
sudo make
</code></p>

<p>It's a good idea to run the included tests to make sure everything went smoothly (<strong>warning</strong>: this caused a lot of System prompts about allowing Redis connections).</p>

<p><code>
make test
</code></p>

<p>Fire up the server on localhost.</p>

<p><code>
redis-server
</code></p>

<p>To use the Redis console, <code>redis-server</code> must already be running (in a separate tab/window).</p>

<p><code>
redis-cli
</code></p>

    <updated>2011-10-20T00:00:00-07:00</updated>
    <id>http://peterschaadt.com/blog/2011/10/20/silicon-valley-code-camp</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>This October I was fortunate enough to be able to attend <a href="http://www.siliconvalley-codecamp.com/">Silicon Valley Code Camp</a> at Foothill Community College in sunny Los Altos, California. A two-day event, SVCC consisted of a diverse collection of tech talks and demos. A stronge presence of corporate sponsors such as Google, Box, Adobe, Microsoft, Bitbucket, Twilio, and 10gen ensured an ample supply of coffee, muffins, and catered sandwiches for the 2,247 in attendance. This was the first tech conference I have attended, and while I am the spritely age of 21, I noticed I was one of the youngest people on site.</p>

<h2>Day 1, Saturday</h2>

<p>The morning kicked off with a personal highlight, hearing Douglas Crawford, author of one of my favorite technical books, <em>Javascript: The Good Parts</em>, give his "ECMAScript 5: The New Parts" talk. His presentation sparked a fantastic discussion on the future direction of Javascript and its role in web development as well as its surge in popularity among mobile frameworks.</p>

<p>For my next talk I headed over to an "Introduction to MongoDB," given by Manish Pandit, Director of Engineering at IGN. It's rare that binary JSON, server replication, and humor are combined in a presentation but a great job was done entertaining the crowded auditorium while we learned the basics of MongoDB. We viewed ad-hoc queries being made on production servers (I hope he didn't get in trouble!) and got a great look at being productive with the mongo shell.</p>

<p>After sandwiches provided courtesy of Google, I went to an Android Tablet application programming session which showed off the capabilities of the Android 3.x SDK. We used working code snippets to demonstrate some of the new features and picked through a couple sample applications.</p>

<h2>Day 2, Sunday</h2>

<p>With the passing of Steve Jobs less than a week earlier, many of us gathered in a packed room Sunday to mourn the loss of one of the world's greatest leaders and innovators. Many attendees shared personal anecdotes of their encounters with Steve that lent unique insight into his world.</p>

<p>I followed this with an in-depth session exploring the world that is Vim. Many people in the crowd were split by the question of their favorite code editor and soon a strong, but informed, debate ensued between the entrenched users of Vim and Emacs. This session was just as much about development practices as much as it was about programming culture and I got to pick up many great insights on achieving maximum workflow productivity.</p>

<p>I finished the afternoon with a session on current and upcoming trends in web analytics. This fascinating presentation discussed the rise in event-based tracking as well as the emerging desire for mobile application analytics. Considering <a href="https://www.leftronic.com">Leftronic</a>, the startup I started working for in September, offers a lot of dashboard widgets utilizing APIs for web analytics, I felt like I walked away from this session with a newfound understanding of web analytics and their importance in generating actionable business intelligence data.</p>

<p>In addition to the many interesting topics I was exposed to at the tech talks, I got to demo the latest Windows Phone Mango update, watch an autonomous robot navigate with just Microsoft Kinect sensors, and see fork bombs test the autoscaling capabilities of some cloud-hosted applications.</p>
