Before Web 3.0 takes the Silicon Valley by storm I'd like to fulfill my Web 2.0 obligation of maintaining a personal blog. This blog will serve as a collection of ideas, observations, thought-provoking monologues (or is it monoblogs?), and a number of technical posts. The content may get dry at times but be confident that when I do make jokes, they'll be sharp and brimming with sarcastic wit.

This blog was built using Octopress, a Jekyll framework, and will be hosted on Heroku. I've found it an annoyance to maintain Wordpress and a database and I've decided the portable solution that Jekyll provides is best for my purposes. Additionally, you can view this blog's source code repository on [Github](https://github.com/peterfschaadt/my-blog).

Be sure to check back frequently for updates (subscription feature hopefully coming soon). Feel free to [contact me](mailto:peter.schaadt@gmail.com) if you have any questions or suggestions!
